SudokuApp.py is the file that the Sudoku Solver was in.
Change the Sudoku's size by changing the value of sudokuSize at line 9.
Change the Sudoku's initial entries by changing the list of tuples from lines 109-116.
Each tuple in the list of tuples contain three numbers: the first being the row number of the entry, the second being the column number of the entry and the last of the entry.
The values inserted is taken from a Sudoku puzzle in https://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~sandiway/sudoku/examples.html

SudokuApp - Calculations.xlsx is the file that I used to see the mathematical relationships between the cells and that of the rows, columns and big box of the entry.

NOTICE: This solver is not optimized and may fail (not foul proof). :P
